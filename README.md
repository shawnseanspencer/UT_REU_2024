# UT_REU_2024
Collection of the code I wrote for my REU in CMP at UT over the summer of 2024.

 Mostly has to do with interfacing PyARPES with the Momentum Microscope. Much of this code is setup dependent and will probably not run without minor/major tweaking. Certain data analysis techniques could be run on example data provided with PyARPES package.
